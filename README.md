Overview
This Power BI dashboard analyzes daily air pollutant concentrations and Air Quality Index (AQI) trends in Delhi over four years. The project aims to provide insights into seasonal pollution patterns, the impact of holidays, and the contribution of key pollutants to help inform environmental policies.

**Key Findings**

AQI averages between 185-220, remaining in the Unhealthy range with hazardous peaks (460–500).

PM10 and PM2.5 are primary pollutants, with pollution decreasing during monsoon months (July–September) and spiking in winter due to dry weather and increased industrial/agricultural activities.

Holidays slightly reduce PM10 and PM2.5 but do not significantly impact NO₂ and CO levels, likely due to continuous vehicular emissions.

2024 shows a rise in PM10 levels despite a decline in PM2.5, highlighting areas needing regulatory attention.

**Features**

Interactive slicers for Year, Month, and Day enable granular timeline analysis.

Visuals include line charts, heatmaps, and pollutant composition bar charts.

AQI classification done using DAX for dynamic categorization.

**Tools Used**

Power BI Desktop

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

Power Query for data transformation

**How to Use**

Use slicers at the top to filter data by date and see pollution trends dynamically.

Explore heatmaps to understand seasonal and daily AQI intensity.

Analyze pollutant contributions across time and special days like holidays.
